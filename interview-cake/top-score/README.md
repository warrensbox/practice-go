You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.

Each round, players receive a score between 0 and 100, which you use to rank them from highest to lowest. So far you're using an algorithm that sorts in O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time, but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast enough. You need a faster sorting algorithm.

Write a method that takes:

an array of unsortedScores
the highestPossibleScore in the game
and returns a sorted array of scores in less than O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time.

For example:

  int[] unsortedScores = {37, 89, 41, 65, 91, 53};
final int HIGHEST_POSSIBLE_SCORE = 100;

int[] sortedScores = sortScores(unsortedScores, HIGHEST_POSSIBLE_SCORE);
// sortedScores: [91, 89, 65, 53, 41, 37]

Java
We’re defining nn as the number of unsortedScores because we’re expecting the number of players to keep climbing.

And, we'll treat highestPossibleScore as a constant instead of factoring it into our big O time and space costs because the highest possible score isn’t going to change. Even if we do redesign the game a little, the scores will stay around the same order of magnitude.
