A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.

They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
Write a method to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

They are defined as objects of Rectangle class:

  public class Rectangle {

    // coordinates of bottom left corner
    private int leftX;
    private int bottomY;

    // dimensions
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle() {}

    public Rectangle(int leftX, int bottomY, int width, int height) {
        this.leftX = leftX;
        this.bottomY = bottomY;
        this.width  = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public int getLeftX() {
        return leftX;
    }

    public int getBottomY() {
        return bottomY;
    }

    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    public int getHeight() {
        return height;
    }
}
