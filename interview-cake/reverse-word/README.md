You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a method reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words in place. ↴

Why an array of characters instead of a string?

The goal of this question is to practice manipulating strings in place. Since we're modifying the message, we need a mutable ↴ type like an array, instead of Java's immutable strings.

For example:

  char[] message = { 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', ' ',
                   'p', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd', ' ',
                   's', 't', 'e', 'a', 'l' };

reverseWords(message);

System.out.println(message);
// prints: "steal pound cake"

Java
When writing your method, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
